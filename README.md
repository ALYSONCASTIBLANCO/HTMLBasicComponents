# HTMLBasicComponents

This repository contains a collection of reusable and fully commented HTML and CSS components, designed for educational use. Students and developers can use these elements to build headers, banners, hero sections, login forms, cards, and more in their own web projects.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a **reference guide** for web development students. Each file provides practical examples of how to structure components using **pure HTML and CSS**, with some optional integrations (like Bootstrap, SoundCloud embeds, or PHP dynamic behavior).
